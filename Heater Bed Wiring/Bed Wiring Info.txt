Basically you dont want to use the inner 2 traces as that is the old Thermistor. I couldnt work out a way to make it reliable, so I replaced it with a normal glass bead thermistor and removed the SMD components from it.


The rest of the pads are split evenly on either side as the heater power. it's not important which way you wire it as it isnt polarised.
