The outer most two traces are for the SMD thermistor of the heat pad. The only required action is to desolder the one resistor on its own. The rest of the traces are split
evenly, mark the inner/middle two traces and avoid soldering on them. This will avoid a short that could cause a fire. 

The SMD capacitors are fine to keep, these will smooth the heating power/current across the heat bed element.
